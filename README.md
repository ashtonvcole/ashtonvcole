# Howdy!
My name is Ashton Cole. I'm a Computational Engineering student at the University of Texas at Austin.

Check out some of the exciting things that I've been working on!

## Repositories

- [iss_tracker](https://github.com/ashtonvcole/iss_tracker) A COE 332 mid-term assignment to create a Python Flask API to access ISS position data. [Detailed Report]()
- [COE_332](https://github.com/ashtonvcole/COE_332) Assorted assignments for Software Engineering and Design demonstrating proficiency in Python, Flask, Docker, and Kubernetes.
- [Amazon_Delivery_Truck_Simulation](https://github.com/Kelach/Amazon_Delivery_Truck_Simulation) A C++-based simulation solving the Multiple Traveling Salesmane Problem for a hypothetical delivery company. This includes experiments investigating how applying constraints (e.g. limiting how far a salesman can travel in a day) creates unsustainable backlogging conditions.
- [Academic](https://github.com/ashtonvcole/Academic) Assorted assignments and projects from my academic career worth sharing. Most apply numerical methods to solve complex engineering problems. Programming languages include MATLAB, C++, and Python.
